= Testing template
  Hello world

  This is a test of the new template format I wrote. I sure do hope it works
  correctly and does not cause any issues!

- How it works
  The answer is quite simple. It reads any given template line-by-line and then
  uses the first character of that line to determine the final appearance of
  that line. For example, putting an equals sign (=) as the first character of
  a line will turn it into a heading.

  Below is a small example of a document in this little template language:

` = Hello world
`   This is a template
`
` - Template language
`   qeaml made this!
- But why?
  I just had this idea in the back of my head. And I turned it into reality.
